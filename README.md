# FYP-Navigation-System
# Personal Inertial Navigation System (PINS) with Loran Transmission Receiver

> A wearable navigation system designed for individuals with memory loss or cognitive impairments. The system integrates Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) with a Loran-C signal receiver to provide reliable location tracking, especially in GPS-denied environments.

üìç Project Overview

This project aims to develop a Personal Inertial Navigation System (PINS) that offers accurate and continuous location tracking. By combining IMU data with Loran-C signals and advanced Kalman filtering techniques (EKF, UKF, LKF), the system can maintain reliable navigation during GPS outages.

üéØ Objectives

- Develop a wearable navigation system for cognitively impaired users
- Integrate Loran-C reception with IMU-based INS
- Enhance accuracy using Kalman filter variants (EKF, UKF, LKF)
- Enable remote monitoring by caregivers
